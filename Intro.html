        <h1>This a heading 1 element</h1> <br>
        <p>
            This is the start of a really short paragraph. It has
            some other nested tags to emphasise/highlight some of
            the text. For example:
        <b>This is bold text.</b>
            And, even more exciting:
        <i>This is italic text!</i>
        </p> <br>
        <p> This is a paragraph explaining the image below. Remember:
            images use a self-closing tag, and the image URL is set by
            the "src" attribute.
